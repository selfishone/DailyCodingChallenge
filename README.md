Coding Strategies:
1. Recursion: To implement this we need to define the base cases and then a iteration variable, base cases will help 
   to end the recursion loop. 
2. Iterative strategies are better space wise because we dont store method calls<related data> in a call stack, where as recursive            solutions are simpler to imagine and write 

Strategies to process arrays:
1.	Two pointers from both ends of array
2.	Sort arrays before processing. 
3. If you want to shift the array elements left or right its better to maintain the head of array at particular index and move the head
